    <p>A fish (pl.: fish or fishes) is an aquatic, crnaite, gill-bearing animal that lacks limbs with digits. 
        Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish 
        as well as various extinct celated groups. Approximately 95% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, 
        belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those being teleosts.</p>
